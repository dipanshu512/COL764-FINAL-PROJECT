# COL764-FINAL-PROJECT
An Information Retrieval Project based on Legal search


**Abstract Idea:**
In countries like India following the Common Law system, there are two primary sources
of law â€“ Statutes (established laws) and Precedents (prior cases). Statutes deal with
applying legal principles to a situation (facts/scenario/circumstances which lead to filing
the case). Precedents or prior cases help a lawyer understand how the Court has dealt
with similar scenarios in the past, and prepare the legal reasoning accordingly.
When a lawyer is presented with a situation (that will potentially lead to the filing of a
case), it will be very beneficial to him/her if there is an automatic system that identifies a
set of related prior cases involving similar situations as well as statutes/acts that can be
most suited to the purpose in the given situation. Such a system shall not only help a
lawyer but also benefit a common man, in a way of getting a preliminary understanding,
even before he/she approaches a lawyer. It shall assist him/her in identifying where
his/her legal problem fits, what legal actions he/she can proceed with (through statutes)
and what were the outcomes of similar cases (through precedents).

**Problem Statements:**
The main goal of our problem is to identify the most relevant cases related to the given
situation. This is achieved by the following subtasks:
1. The topic words are extracted from the given situation.
2. Then topic words are considered as a query to search the relevant prior cases by
using the retrieval model.
To implement such a model, we divide the problem into two tasks:
**Task 1: Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation
Task 2: Identifying most relevant statutes for a given situation**

**Dataset and problem source:**
The problem is taken from the AILA tasks in 2019. [link:
